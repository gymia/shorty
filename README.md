URL Shortener
================

## System requirements:

- Node.JS
- Redis

You can install both of these with your system's package manager.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Make sure Redis is available on default port (or run it with `redis-server`)
4. Run `npm start`

App starts on port 3000 by default, but you can override this with environment variable:

    PORT=5000 npm start

## Running tests

To run the tests you need to have `mocha` installed globally:

    npm install -g mocha

To run the whole suite use `npm test` command.

**Note** One of the tests (integration) requires Redis server to be running.
